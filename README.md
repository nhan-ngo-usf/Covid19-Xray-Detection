Covid19-Xray-detection

Overview

Covid19-Xray-detection is a project aimed at developing a model for predicting whether an X-ray image depicts a case of Covid-19 or is normal. This repository utilizes datasets from the COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset and the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of X-ray images obtained from the COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset and the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset. These datasets contain images labeled as either COVID-19 positive or normal.

COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset: Contains X-ray images of COVID-19 cases along with associated metadata.
Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia): Includes X-ray images of patients with pneumonia, serving as the normal class for this binary classification task.
Model

The model is developed using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have demonstrated promising results in image classification tasks, making them suitable for analyzing X-ray images.
